# javascript-color-game
### [A JavaScript based 'game' to hone js skills.]
The game works by setting up an array of colors in clackable squares on the screen. On of these colors matches a pre-defined 'correct' color, whose rgb code is displayed on top of the screen. The player clicks on the ssquare whose color he/she thinks matches the given rgb code. Pretty neat, ja?

## The logic
Aaaaam....read the js code. It's not that hard to understand. Really it isn't.

## Getting started
Clone the repo as is to your machine. Open the html file (in the src folder) and you're ready to play. Simple as that.

## Prerequistes
Besides a browser (Chrome is preferred, for reasons I need not give), none whatsoever.
